A person may have mild symptoms for about one week, then worsen rapidly. Let your doctor know if your symptoms quickly worsen over a short period of time. Also call the doctor right away if you or a loved one with COVID-19 experience any of the following emergency symptoms: trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to arouse the person, or bluish lips or face."

You might be asked to exercise self-quarantine when you have these days lower back from touring to a part of the country or the world wherein covid-19 is spreading hastily, or when you have knowingly been exposed to an inflamed individual."
